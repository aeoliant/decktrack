decktrack
=========

Barebones application to manually track what cards are left in your Hearthstone deck.

#####Instructions
1. Copy [**decktrack.html**](https://github.com/aeoliant/decktrack/blob/master/decktrack.html) to your computer.
2. Edit [**decktrack.html**](https://github.com/aeoliant/decktrack/blob/master/decktrack.html) to match your deck. For example, the (incomplete) deck below contains two copies of *Redemption* and one copy of *Alexstrasza*. You can add or delete lines.

    ```html
<!-- Edit section below to match your deck -->
<li count="2" cost="1">Redemption</li>
<li count="1" cost="9">Alexstrasza</li>
<!-- Edit section above to match your deck -->
   ```

3. Open [**decktrack.html**](https://github.com/aeoliant/decktrack/blob/master/decktrack.html) in your favourite web browser.
4. As you draw cards from your deck, click on them to remove them from the list.
5. To refresh the list (for when the game ends), just refresh the webpage.
6. I recommend saving a version of [**decktrack.html**](https://github.com/aeoliant/decktrack/blob/master/decktrack.html) for each of your decks do you don't have to edit them everytime you switch decks.
